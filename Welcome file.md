# Table Tennis Deep Trainer

This project is from the Harvard Course: DGMD S-14 Wearable Devices and Computer Vision (Summer 2021).

# Abstract

Wearable devices have become an important technique to capture data for activity recognition, and advanced sports programs are beginning to incorporate sophisticated methods of capturing this data, analyzing the results and building models to aid in the development of athletic skills training. Table tennis is a complex technical sport that requires high levels of skill and concentration that can only be developed through practice and repetition. This project proposes a Table Tennis Trainer that provides feedback to improve stroke technique. There are many strokes in table tennis and numerous styles of play. This project focuses on the Forehand Drive. There is almost an infinite combination of things at play when swinging a racket, but this trainer is tuned to the individual and the specific conditions. One indicator of success of a forehand drive is the angle of the racket in the player’s hand. The Table Tennis Deep Trainer uses Deep Learning to train a model to recognize the problem with the swing and inform the player of their tendency and indicate whether a swing was proper or one of two forms of improper technique - thus utilizing a three class classifier to help the player improve skills.
